## Containers

Beacon design system features two major layouts: Landing Layout and Dashboard Layout, each with a unique size. To ensure consistency,
we use a Container component that must be called for either components composition.

<div style={{ marginTop: '50px' }}>
  <img src="/dash-layout.png" alt="beacon design layout" />
</div>

#### Dashboard Layout

For the Dashboard view, it's recommended to wrap components with the Dash Container, as shown below:

```Jsx
 import { Container } from '@rotational/beacon-ds'

  const DashLayout: React.FC () =>{
   return (

       <Container dash >

         .... your children

       </Container>
   )
  }
```

#### Landing Layout

```Jsx
 import { Container } from '@rotational/beacon-ds'

  const LandingLayout: React.FC () =>{
   return (
    // this will apply max-w-[1660px]
       <Container >

         .... your children

       </Container>
   )
  }
```

#### Breakpoint Layout

Our design system is built using Tailwind and follows the default Tailwind breakpoints.
To implement max-w-7xl, we can use breakpoint types xs, md, lg, xl.

```Jsx
 import { Container } from '@rotational/beacon-ds'

  const ContentBody: React.FC () =>{
   return (
       <Container brk='xl' > // this will apply max-w-7xl

         .... your children

       </Container>
   )
  }
```
